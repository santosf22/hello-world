The start of my journey in becoming a software engineer

Hello github, I am a computer engineering student on my way to becoming a software engineer.
I will be using github to document my progress as a programmer starting from 0 and will look to improve and grow as a programmer.

I will be starting from the basics and my plan of action will include:

1) Learning the fundamentals of Computer Science by taking the CS50 Harvard course
2) Learn about the industry as a whole (understand CS, software development, web development, how the web works, what http/server/client, etc.. are)
3) Learn HTML/CSS (through MDN documentation/books/building programs and micro-components)
4) Start building projects on git, github and cli (mainly build up github profile)
5) Learn Javascript (through books, free youtube courses, solving algorithms and building projects)
6) Learn Node.js (MDN documentation, youtube crash courses, blog tutorials)
7) Learn React or Vue
8) Finish my degree in Computer Engineering and start looking for job (in 3 years)
9) Keep learning and continue to grow
